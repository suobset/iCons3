# Testable Hypothesis

* Define “wasteful consumption” to be tangible
* Meters would demonstrate that the library is heated inconsistently and unevenly.
* Meters would demonstrate that lights are on.
* Need a list of type of sensors we would use and the precision of our measurements.

## Planned Schedule, on a weekly basis:

* 2/24
  * Project Proposal
  * Rough Draft of Block Diagram
  * Thermodynamic calculation of library’s heating potential (in an ideal circumstance)
  * Qualitative heat map of the library (This website!!!)
* 3/1
  * Finalized block diagram
  * Cost estimate of proposed system
  * Specification for the metering devices.
* 3/8
  * Building prototype boards [~5]  for the block diagram. 
  * Initial evaluation/data collection week of the system for the five prototype boards
* 3/22
  * Visualization of the data collected in previous week
  * Ordering the PCBs 
* 3/29
  * Setting up the metering system
  * Recording and analyzing preliminary data.
* 4/5 [Midway Presentation Friday](./hypo-plan)
  * Midway Presentation with preliminary data collected from this week that the system has been up.
* 4/12, 4/19, 4/21 4/28
  * Collect data
  * Build a dashboard to look at the data collected.
* 5/3
  * Make figures for the data based on predictions.
* 5/10
  * Final Presentation
  * Poster Presentation
