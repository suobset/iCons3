# Discussion

* Change in EWMA -> potentially more energy reduction
* Change in frequency -> potentially less energy reduction
* Higher frequency -> more importance in EWMA
* Lower EWMA -> more importance in frequency 

## Conclusions

1. By manipulating EWMA and frequency, we can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining the setpoint temperatures for occupancy comfort.
2. Average temperature remains roughly constant
3. Less power consumption -> slightly greater reaction time

## Future Work

1. Account for temperature setpoints being manipulated by occupants
2. Consider psychological aspects of occupancy comfort
3. Expand simulation to be able to account for more controller specifications
