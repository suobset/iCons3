# Simulation

This is currently a placeholder page to hold the Simulink version of the Simulator. A UI will be created for the Poster Session and pushed on to this page, for people to access without the need for installing MATLAB.

To run the simulation, you'll need to have MATLAB + Simulink installed on your computer. UMass provides free academic licenses to access simulink, <a href="https://www.umass.edu/it/software/matlab">download it here</a>.

Download the Simulink files <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons3/raw/main/MATLAB/simulation.slx">here</a>.

View it in the source code <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons3/tree/main/MATLAB">here</a>. Note: this directory contains all the MATLAB files for archival purposes, but this specific simulation is titled ```simulation.slx```.
