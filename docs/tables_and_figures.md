# Tables and Figures

Add info here

PS: For pictures, here are 2 quick options to not break npm (since image linking relatively is not supported out of the box; docusaurus has its own way):

1. add to shared drive (create a new folder), make image visibility public, and link image that way
2. add to a dir on this repo, push that, get the rawgithubusercontent URL (by opening the image in the repo online), link that
3. ask me to do it

Whichever option you choose, I'll get it in the Docusaurus way later so no worries :)
