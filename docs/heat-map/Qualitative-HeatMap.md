# Qualitative Data Map

* The following Interactive Map was created by conducting a Qualitative Analysis across the W.E.B. Du Bois Library. 
* Each floor was visited by at least one team member, and temperature data, thermostat information, lighting and electricity usage, and a personal "comfort score" ranging between 0-100 (in divisions of 5) was given to each floor.
