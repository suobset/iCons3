# Welcome

The following website contains a comprehensive set of all resources related to the iCons 3 Project done by Anvitha, Emily, Kush, and Frank during Spring 2023. You can access our Research Papers, Posters, References, Citations, and even the Simulations that we built and used for this project.

<b>Imp: This website only has a wide-area glance of our research; proper in-depth details are covered in the research paper, which is also linked in the sidebar.</b>

This website will be updated with a full archive that goes over our 4 different iterations of different research topics, and the work done in all those iterations. The failed iterations were instrumental in us landing on the current project.

All resources can be navigated via the sidebar on the left (or the menu item on Mobile). The simulation can be accessed via the links on the header (or menu item on mobile), or directly from <a href="/simulation">here</a>.
