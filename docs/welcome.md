# Welcome

The following website contains a comprehensive set of all resources related to the iCons 3 Project done by Anvitha, Emily, Kush, and Frank during Spring 2023. You can access our Research Papers, Posters, References, Citations, and even the Simulations that we built and used for this project.

<b>Imp: This website will be updated with more info and interactive graphs + simulations before Poster session, and also contain our full paper once that is done</b>

All resources can be navigated via the sidebar on the left (or the menu item on Mobile). The simulation can be accessed via the links on the header (or menu item on mobile), or directly from <a href="/simulation">here</a>.
