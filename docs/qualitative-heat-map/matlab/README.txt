The way this works is basically:

1. We created these figures on MATLAB
2. Exported them to html, one for each floor
3. Pushed the html to a separate repository, otherwise it would disturb Docusaurus
   1. [Other Repository](https://github.com/suobset/iCons)
   2. This other repository has GitHub Pages already activated
4. Linked iFrames from this other repository to our documentation
